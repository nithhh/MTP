This project explores Structured State Space models especially MAMBA for fine-tuned text classification across multiple datasets. A classification head is added on top of the Mamba backbone, and training is performed on three different benchmark datasets:

1) 20 Newsgroups

2) IMDb

3) RCV1

The code for training and evaluation on each dataset is included in this repository.
